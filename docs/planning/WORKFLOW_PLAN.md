# NuCRM Production Rollout Plan — Phases 0 → 8

This is the canonical, sequenced plan for shipping the end-to-end customer
workflow + AI multi-provider rollout. Each phase is mergeable on its own,
verified with `tsc --noEmit`, `vitest run`, and `npm run build` before push.

Phases marked **DONE** have shipped on a branch (PR linked).
Phases marked **NEXT SESSION** are queued and described in enough detail
that any session can pick them up cleanly.

---

## Mental model

```
  Person (Contact)                              ← one record per real person/email
  ├── Lead LD-2025-001  (product: AI CRM)       ← a sales conversation
  │   ├── BANT discovery                        ← what does the client want
  │   ├── Assignments: Alice → Bob → Carol      ← handoff trail (lead_assignments)
  │   ├── Offers (services/products + qty + price + status)   ← Phase 4
  │   ├── Communications: 12 emails, 3 calls, 1 meeting       ← activities table
  │   └── Status: qualified → proposal → won/lost
  ├── Lead LD-2025-007  (product: Helpdesk)     ← same person, new conversation
  │   └── Status: nurturing
  └── Lead LD-2026-003  (product: Real Estate)
      └── Status: new

  → Contact detail page surfaces ALL of this in a single view.
```

The shift from the old model: **lead intake immediately attaches to a
contact** (existing-by-email or new). "Convert" stops meaning "create
contact" and starts meaning "promote this conversation into a deal".

---

## Phase 0 — Schema additions + migration + backfill — **DONE**

**Branch**: `feat/workflow-foundation` (current)
**Migration**: `drizzle/migrations/0010_workflow_foundation.sql`

Schema (additive only, no destructive ops):
- `leads.contact_id`  nullable FK → `contacts.id` (one contact, many leads)
- `leads.lead_oid`    text — human-readable per-tenant id (`LD-2025-001`)
- `leads.product_id`  text — `lib/products/registry.ts` key
- New `lead_offers`             — what was offered to the client per lead
- New `ai_providers`            — super-admin provider allow-list + flags
- New `tenant_ai_credentials`   — per-tenant BYO key + approval workflow

Backfill: `UPDATE leads SET contact_id = converted_contact_id WHERE
contact_id IS NULL AND converted_contact_id IS NOT NULL`.

Seeds: 6 canonical AI providers (`openai`, `anthropic`, `groq`, `mistral`,
`ollama`, `openai-compatible`).

Journal entries added for `0008`, `0009`, `0010` (journal was stale).

**Verified**: `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `vitest run` 435 passed (2 pre-existing
PG-not-running failures unchanged), `npm run build` succeeded.

---

## Phase 1 — Lead intake auto-attaches to contact — **DONE**

**Branch**: same as Phase 0 — shipped together as PR-A.

Files:
- `lib/contacts/resolve.ts`           — `resolveOrCreateContactForLead({ tx, tenantId, userId, lead })` + `resolveOrCreateCompany`
- `lib/leads/oid.ts`                  — `generateLeadOid({ tx, tenantId })` → `LD-{year}-{NNN}`
- `app/api/tenant/leads/route.ts`     — POST runs in a transaction:
  1. `resolveOrCreateContactForLead` (email dedup)
  2. `generateLeadOid`
  3. insert lead with `contactId`, `leadOid`, `productId`
  4. emit `lead_activities` row + unified `activities` row (`event_type='lead_created'`)
- `app/api/tenant/leads/import/route.ts` — rewritten cleanly: per-row
  transaction; uses helper for each row; skipDuplicates / updateExisting
  preserved; reports `newContacts` / `mergedContacts` counts; the broken
  `db.insert().values()` activity-log call at the end is removed.
- `app/api/tenant/leads/[id]/convert/route.ts` — now respects an existing
  `lead.contact_id` (skips email dedup if already linked), backfills
  `lead.contact_id` for legacy leads. Convert is no longer the contact-creation
  path; for new leads it only updates the contact and creates the deal.

**Form submit** (`app/api/forms/submit/route.ts`) is intentionally left alone —
it creates contacts directly (newsletter / marketing forms), not leads.
Sales-intent forms that should create a lead instead are a future
"form intent type" feature handled in Phase 8.

---

## Phase 2 — Contact "Leads" tab + GET API — **DONE**

**Branch**: same as Phase 0/1.

Files:
- `app/api/tenant/contacts/[id]/leads/route.ts` — `GET` returns every lead
  linked to the contact, enriched with `assigned_name`, `assigned_avatar`,
  `offer_total`, `offer_count`, `offer_currency` (open offers only), plus
  status / stage / score / value / BANT summary fields.
- `components/tenant/contact-detail-client.tsx` — adds a `Leads` tab to the
  tab bar; lazy-fetches when activated; renders one row per lead with:
  - lead OID + status pill + product chip
  - BANT summary line (budget · timeline · need)
  - assignee, last-activity time, score
  - open offer total (or estimated value as fallback)
  - click → navigate to `/tenant/leads/{id}`

**Acceptance**: opening any contact shows every lead (past + present),
one-click jump into each.

---

## Phase 3 — Handoff trail visible — **DONE**

**Branch**: same as Phase 0/1/2.

Files:
- `app/api/tenant/leads/[id]/assign/route.ts` — `POST { assigned_to, reason? }`:
  1. validates `assigned_to` is a member of the tenant via `tenant_members`
  2. flips `leads.assigned_to`
  3. inserts `lead_assignments` row (handoff history)
  4. inserts `lead_activities` row (`activity_type='reassigned'`)
  5. inserts unified `activities` row (`event_type='lead_reassigned'`,
     metadata: `from_user_id`, `from_user_name`, `to_user_id`,
     `to_user_name`, `reason`)
  6. fires audit log + assignee notification
- `components/tenant/lead-detail-client.tsx` — adds a "Hand off" button
  next to "Edit"; opens a modal with team-member dropdown + reason textarea;
  calls the new endpoint; toast + `router.refresh()` on success.

**Note**: a future polish is to add `lead_reassigned` to `EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG`
in `components/tenant/contact-timeline.tsx` so the timeline renders a
dedicated icon/color for it (currently uses the `Activity` fallback which
still works correctly).

---

## Phase 4 — Offers system (what the customer was offered) — **NEXT SESSION**

Goal: capture line-item-level offer data per lead so reps can see
"customer wanted X for Y price" without diving into deals.

API (new):
- `GET    /api/tenant/leads/[id]/offers`           — list
- `POST   /api/tenant/leads/[id]/offers`           — create
- `PATCH  /api/tenant/leads/[id]/offers/[offerId]` — update
- `DELETE /api/tenant/leads/[id]/offers/[offerId]` — soft-delete (sets
  `deleted_at`)

UI:
- New `Offers` section on `lead-detail-client.tsx` (card under BANT). Inline
  add/edit/delete; each row picks from `services` catalog or accepts free-form
  description, plus qty, unit price, currency, status (`proposed` / `accepted`
  / `rejected` / `withdrawn`).
- Auto-sum total displayed at bottom; writing back to `lead.value` for
  forecasting.

Activity events:
- `offer_added`, `offer_status_changed` written to `activities` (entityType
  `lead`); show on contact timeline too.
- Add corresponding entries in `EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG`
  (`components/tenant/contact-timeline.tsx`).

Convert hook:
- When a lead is converted to a deal, copy each non-rejected offer into
  `quote_line_items` or `deal_products` (whichever fits the new deal's
  pipeline contract — check both schemas in `drizzle/schema/billing.ts` and
  `drizzle/schema/crm.ts`).

Acceptance: opening a lead shows what was offered; opening the contact
shows offers across all their leads via the existing Leads tab's
`offer_total`/`offer_count` columns; on convert, the deal pre-populates
with the offer line items.

---

## Phase 5 — AI multi-provider gateway — **NEXT SESSION**

Goal: replace the hardcoded Anthropic call with a provider-agnostic
gateway that supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, and any
OpenAI-compatible base URL.

Files (new):
- `lib/ai/gateway.ts` — single export:
  ```ts
  createCompletion({
    tenantId, userId,
    providerKey?,           // override; otherwise pick tenant default
    model?,                 // override; otherwise tenant default for that provider
    messages,               // OpenAI-style { role, content }[]
    stream?,                // boolean — returns ReadableStream when true
    tools?,                 // function-calling spec, normalised across providers
    fallbackChain?,         // override the credential's own fallbackChain
  }): Promise<{ text, usage } | ReadableStream>
  ```
- `lib/ai/providers/openai.ts`, `anthropic.ts`, `groq.ts`, `mistral.ts`,
  `ollama.ts`, `compatible.ts` — adapters. OpenAI / Groq / Mistral / Ollama
  / openai-compatible all share an OpenAI-shape adapter parameterised on
  base URL + auth header.
- `lib/crypto/secrets.ts` — `encryptSecret` / `decryptSecret` (AES-GCM with
  a key derived from `process.env.SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`). Add to `.env.example`.

Modify:
- `app/api/tenant/ai/route.ts` — calls `createCompletion`; supports
  `?stream=1` for SSE; preserves the existing `score_lead`, `predict_deal`,
  `enrich_contact`, `suggest_followup`, `draft_email` actions but routes
  the prompt through `createCompletion`.
- `lib/ai/common.ts` — keep `checkTokenAndLimits` + `recordUsage` exactly
  as-is; gateway calls them.

Tenant settings shape on `tenantModules['ai-assistant'].settings` (kept
for backwards compat) is **deprecated** and replaced by
`tenant_ai_credentials` rows. Migration path: on first `createCompletion`
call, if a tenant has the legacy `settings.anthropic_api_key` and no
`tenant_ai_credentials` row, create one with `provider_key='anthropic'`
and `status='approved'` (legacy users grandfathered).

Multi-provider fallback:
- On 5xx / timeout / rate-limit, gateway iterates `fallbackChain`. Records
  the failure in `tenantAiCredentials.errorCount` and bumps `lastUsedAt` on
  success.

No mocks anywhere — every adapter hits a real API endpoint or local Ollama.

Acceptance: same `score_lead` action runs against any of the 6 providers
by changing the credential row; streaming works end-to-end with curl;
`tsc` 0 errors; tests still pass.

---

## Phase 6 — AI provider approval workflow — **NEXT SESSION**

Depends on Phase 5.

Super-admin pages:
- `app/superadmin/ai-providers/page.tsx` — toggle each provider's
  `enabled`, `allow_platform_key`; edit `rate_limits`. Server actions on
  the page hit `/api/superadmin/ai-providers`.
- `app/superadmin/ai-credentials/page.tsx` — pending-approval queue with
  one-click approve / reject; reject requires a reason. Approve sets
  `status='approved'`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`. Notify tenant owner
  via in-app + email.

Tenant page:
- `app/tenant/settings/ai/page.tsx` — table of the tenant's
  `tenant_ai_credentials` rows with status badge (pending / approved /
  rejected / revoked). Form to create a new credential (provider dropdown
  filtered to enabled providers + model + key + base URL override). On
  submit, status is `pending`; can be `revoke`d any time.

Gateway enforcement:
- `lib/ai/gateway.ts` refuses to call when:
  1. credential `status !== 'approved'`, OR
  2. linked `ai_providers.enabled === false`.
  Returns a clear `403 { error: 'Provider pending approval' | 'Provider disabled by platform' }`.

Acceptance: tenant saves a key → super-admin sees pending → approves →
tenant's AI calls work. Rejecting blocks them with a clear error.

---

## Phase 7 — AI surfaced in the UI — **NEXT SESSION**

Depends on Phases 5, 6.

Surfaces:
1. **Score this lead with AI** button on `lead-detail-client.tsx` BANT
   card. Calls `score_lead`; writes `lead.score` and appends a
   `score_reason` paragraph to `lead.internalNotes`. User-editable before
   apply.
2. **Suggest next action** panel on `contact-detail-client.tsx` Activity
   tab. Calls `suggest_followup`; renders the
   `{ action, timing, channel, script }` JSON in editable inputs. Apply
   button creates a task / drafts an email / books a meeting depending on
   channel.
3. **Draft email with AI** button in any email composer drawer. Calls
   `draft_email`; fills the textarea, user can edit before sending.
4. **Predict outcome** chip on each deal card in
   `app/tenant/deals/kanban/page.tsx`. Calls `predict_deal`; popover shows
   win probability + risk factors + recommendations.
5. **AI digest** dashboard widget at `app/tenant/dashboard/page.tsx` — top
   3 leads to call today, top 3 deals at risk. Cron-cached for 15 min via
   `lib/cache/redis.ts` to avoid spamming the gateway.

Empty states:
- No provider configured: button shows "Configure AI in Settings → AI"
  with deep link.
- Provider pending approval: button disabled, tooltip "Awaiting super-admin
  approval".

Acceptance: all 5 surfaces live; with an approved tenant credential,
clicking each one produces a real, editable output; with no provider,
the deep link works.

## Phase 8 — Cleanups (mergeable any time, in any order) — **NEXT SESSION**

Each item is a small standalone PR.

| ID | Item | Files |
|---|---|---|
| 8a | Industry-template-driven lead intake forms (per-vertical fields) | `lib/industry-templates/*`, `app/forms/[id]/page.tsx`, `components/tenant/lead-import-modal.tsx` |
| 8b | Bulk action bar lift to companies / deals / tasks / users | extract `hooks/useBulkSelection.ts` from `components/tenant/contacts-client.tsx`; render `BulkActionBar` on each `*-data-table.tsx` |
| 8c | Product entry pages scope data to their `mainPipeline` | `app/tenant/products/[productId]/clients/page.tsx`, etc. — filter by `lifecycle_stage` / `pipeline_id` from `lib/products/registry.ts` |
| 8d | Lead-import modal advertised columns reconciled with importer | `components/tenant/lead-import-modal.tsx` (advertised list) ↔ `app/api/tenant/leads/import/route.ts` `LEAD_COLUMN_MAP` |
| 8e | Stale `in_progress` feature metadata flipped to `completed` | `.agents/tasks/*/features/*.json` |
| 8f | Lead-status PATCH activity log uses correct field name | `app/api/tenant/leads/[id]/route.ts` — change `rawBody.lead_status` to `v.status` (one-liner) |
| 8g | SMS / WhatsApp / chat channels emit `activities` rows | `app/api/tenant/sms/*`, `app/api/tenant/whatsapp/*`, `app/api/tenant/chat/*` — insert `activities` row with appropriate event type. Add `EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG` entries in `components/tenant/contact-timeline.tsx`. |
| 8h | Add `lead_created` and `lead_reassigned` to `EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG` | `components/tenant/contact-timeline.tsx` — give them dedicated icons + colors |
| 8i | `convertedContactId` deprecation note in schema | `drizzle/schema/crm.ts` — comment that `contact_id` is the canonical pointer; `convertedContactId` is kept for legacy reads |

## Recommended sequencing

```
PR-A  Phase 0+1+2+3   Workflow foundation (this PR)             ← DONE / pending merge
PR-B  Phase 4         Offers system
PR-C  Phase 5         AI multi-provider gateway                  (parallel-safe)
PR-D  Phase 6         AI provider approval workflow              (depends on PR-C)
PR-E  Phase 7         AI surfaced in the UI                      (depends on PR-C, PR-D)
PR-F  Phase 8         Cleanups                                   (each subitem its own small PR)
```

PR-C can start in parallel with PR-B because the AI gateway has no schema
dependency on offers.

---

## Verification commands (run before every push)

```bash
# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Tests (the 2 PG-dependent failures in tests/integration/backup-integrity.test.ts are pre-existing)
npx vitest run

# Production build
JWT_SECRET=test-secret-32-chars-minimum-required npm run build
```

All three must be green before push.

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

23 GAPs closed for `v1.0.0`. Detailed in `REMAINING_GAPS.txt`. Includes:
TypeScript zero-error baseline, Zod validation, DOMPurify XSS, strong dev
secrets, Redis-backed rate limit, central `apiError` boundary, v1 API
deprecation, cache layer, pagination, real Drizzle migrations, GitHub
Actions CI/CD, Sentry+Grafana+Prometheus, backup integrity tests, k6 load
tests, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, `next-intl` i18n, mobile-first
(swipeable, pull-to-refresh, bottom-sheet, 44 px tap targets), OpenAPI,
webhook DLQ + manual retry, audit-log SHA-256 chain, RLS pen tests,
bundle splitChunks.

## Phase 1 — Enterprise CRM build (PR #1) ✅

`task-enterprise-crm-build` task: TS errors 63 → 0, `requireModule` /
`requireFeature` gates, `userUsage` + `planLimits` tables, threshold
notifications (80/90/100 %), per-user selective restore, NuCRM SDK
foundation (typed client, 8 resources, HMAC webhook verifier), settings
layout `max-w` cleanup, plan-based auto-install on signup.

## Phase 2 — Industry templates · Stripe · gateway · RBAC · SSO ✅

`task-enterprise-crm-phase2`: 13 industry templates with custom fields,
pipelines, automations and module assignments; raw-fetch Stripe client +
checkout / portal / webhook with HMAC; white-label branding engine
(per-tenant CSS variables, custom-domain validation, sanitised CSS);
multi-frontend `/api/v2/` gateway (API key, X-Tenant-ID, custom-domain,
subdomain resolution); advanced RBAC (field-level, record-level,
approval-workflow tables); SSO/SAML/OIDC core with state-cookie CSRF
defence; webhook expansion (11 → 25 events) with exponential backoff +
DLQ.

## Phase 3 — Compliance · vertical modules · channels · billing ✅

Compliance UI pages; SLA management; auto-assignment rules; documents;
report builder; SMS via Twilio with template interpolation; live chat
with session lifecycle; email open/click pixel + redirect; currency /
tax / e-signature; leaderboards / territories / hierarchy / visitor
tracking. Closed by FEAT-006 fixing 8 review-found security holes
(chat-widget, visitor-tracking, email-tracking, assignment+SLA spread,
leaderboards module gate, e-sign HMAC, public-endpoint rate limits).

---

## Phase 4 — Offers 🔲

> **Note.** The phrase "schema is already in place from Phase 0" maps to
> the existing `quotes` family — `quotes`, `quoteLineItems`, `priceBooks`,
> `priceBookEntries` in `drizzle/schema/crm.ts`. There is **no separate
> `offers` table**. Phase 4 reframes that schema as a customer-facing
> "offer" surface: a quote that has been sent, optionally tied to an
> approval flow, that the buyer can accept or decline.

### 4.1 — Schema delta (small)
- Confirm `quotes` row supports `status` `draft|submitted|accepted|declined|expired`.
- Add `metadata.offer` jsonb scope: `{ accepted_at, accepted_by_email, decline_reason, expires_at, public_token }` (no migration; uses existing `metadata` jsonb).

### 4.2 — Endpoints
- `POST /api/tenant/offers/[quoteId]/send`   — finalise + email link with public token
- `GET  /api/public/offers/[publicToken]`     — buyer view (read-only)
- `POST /api/public/offers/[publicToken]/accept`
- `POST /api/public/offers/[publicToken]/decline`
- Reuse `/api/tenant/quotes/*` for the seller-side CRUD (already exists).

### 4.3 — UI
- `/tenant/offers` — list (filter by `status`)
- `/tenant/offers/[id]` — seller detail with Send / Resend / Cancel
- `/p/offers/[publicToken]` — public buyer page (mobile-first, no auth)

### 4.4 — Workflow integration
- Emit `activities` row on send / accept / decline so the contact timeline
  reflects the lifecycle.
- Wire to **Phase 6 approval workflow** when amount > tenant threshold.
- Wire to **Phase 7 AI digest** so reps see "5 offers awaiting buyer".

---

## Phase 5 — AI multi-provider gateway ✅ (PR #27)

Shipped in `feat/phase-4-ai-gateway-foundation` → PR #27.

### What landed
- `drizzle/schema/ai.ts` — `ai_provider_secrets` (encrypted, AES-256-GCM)
  + `ai_activity` (per-call log) registered in `_registry.ts`.
- `lib/ai/secrets.ts` — `setProviderKey / getProviderKey /
  getProviderKeyMeta / listProviderKeyMeta / deleteProviderKey`.
- `lib/ai/gateway.ts` — `chat({ provider?, model?, system?, messages,
  ... })` with OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq / Ollama, fallback chain,
  per-attempt logging, typed `GatewayError`.
- `app/api/tenant/admin/ai-providers/route.ts` GET / PATCH / DELETE —
  splits config (jsonb) from keys (vault).
- `app/api/tenant/ai/route.ts` — refactored to call `gateway.chat`,
  preserves all 4 actions and the legacy `recordUsage` bookkeeping.
- `app/api/tenant/ai/status/route.ts` — typed Drizzle query against
  `ai_activity`.
- `app/api/tenant/ai/activity/route.ts` GET (paged, filtered, summary)
  + PATCH (mark accepted).
- `app/tenant/ai/activity/page.tsx` — replaces the shell page with a
  real audit table (5 stat cards · 3 filters · pagination · per-row
  thumbs-up/down).

`tsc --noEmit`: 78 errors total (= main baseline; 0 introduced).
`vitest run`: 435 passed; 2 pre-existing PG/backup failures.

---

## Phase 6 — Approval-workflow surfaces 🟡

`drizzle/schema/core.ts` already defines `approvalRequests` with
`{ entityType, entityId, ruleId, status: pending|approved|rejected,
requestedBy, approvedBy, approvedAt, rejectionReason, metadata }`.
Engine code lives at `lib/rbac/approval-workflows.ts` (`checkNeedsApproval`,
`requestApproval`, `approveRequest`, `rejectRequest`).

Missing — to ship in this phase:

### 6.1 — Routes
- `GET  /api/tenant/approvals` — list pending/all
- `PATCH /api/tenant/approvals/[id]` — `{ action: 'approve'|'reject', reason? }`

### 6.2 — UI
- `/tenant/approvals` — manager inbox with filters (status, entity, requester)
- Inline "Pending approval" banner on the source entity (deal, offer, refund)
- Notification matrix entry for `approval_requested` / `approval_approved`

### 6.3 — Wire-in points
- **Phase 4 Offer send** above some `tenants.settings.approval_thresholds.offer_amount`
- Bulk transfer (Phase 3 lift) for sensitive pools
- Manual rule editor in `/tenant/settings/approvals` (small)

## Phase 7 — AI surfaces 🔲

Five capability pages exist as `<AIComingSoon />` shells today
(`/tenant/ai/{draft,lead-scoring,at-risk,summarize,activity}`). Activity
is now real (Phase 5). The other four need backend wiring on top of the
gateway shipped in Phase 5 and the approval engine in Phase 6.

### 7.1 — Score lead
- `drizzle/schema/ai.ts` (extension): `lead_scoring_rules` table
  (factor, weight, condition, active).
- `app/api/tenant/admin/lead-scoring/*` — CRUD + recompute.
- `/tenant/settings/lead-scoring` — drag-orderable factor list, recompute, distribution preview.
- `/tenant/ai/lead-scoring` — ranked-leads table with "why this score" panel.
- Cron `process-lead-scoring` — nightly recompute via `gateway.chat`.

### 7.2 — Suggest follow-up
- `/tenant/ai/suggest` (or in-place on contact detail) — calls existing
  `gateway.chat({ action: 'suggest_followup' })` (already wired).
- One-click "Add as task" / "Draft email" / "Schedule meeting" actions.

### 7.3 — Draft email
- `drizzle/schema/ai.ts` (extension): `ai_draft_templates` (per-tenant
  prompts).
- `app/api/tenant/admin/ai-templates/*` — CRUD.
- `/tenant/settings/ai-templates` page.
- `app/api/tenant/ai/draft/route.ts` — `{ entity_type, entity_id,
  template_id }` → context-hydrated prompt → gateway → diff editor →
  Send via existing email pipe.
- `/tenant/ai/draft` — entity picker + template select + diff editor.

### 7.4 — Predict outcome
- `drizzle/schema/ai.ts` (extension): `at_risk_rules` (stage, max_days_idle, sentiment_threshold).
- `app/api/tenant/admin/at-risk/*` — CRUD.
- `/tenant/settings/at-risk-rules` page.
- `/tenant/ai/at-risk` — flagged-deals table with manager nudge action.
- Cron `process-at-risk` — daily flag run.
- Reuse `gateway.chat({ action: 'predict_deal' })` for per-deal calls.

### 7.5 — AI digest
- New `/tenant/ai/digest` — per-user daily / weekly summary built from
  `ai_activity` + recent contact / deal / lead activity.
- Optional email digest (uses Phase 7.3 once it lands).

## Phase 8 — Cleanups 🔲

Independent items — can land in any order, no dependencies.

### 8.1 — TypeScript debt
- Sweep the 78 `tsc --noEmit` errors carried across recent PRs as
  "unchanged from main".
- Fix the bulk-transfer / user-data routes that import non-existent
  schema columns (`tickets`, `contacts.ownerId`, `deals.ownerId`,
  `deals.value`, `deals.stage`, `activities.type`) — these block
  `npm run build` on Next 16.

### 8.2 — Test stabilisation
- `tests/integration/backup-integrity.test.ts` — needs real Postgres on
  127.0.0.1:5432 + a `tmp/backup-test-corrupt.sql` fixture. Either
  ship a Postgres-in-Docker harness for CI or move these tests behind a
  `INTEGRATION=1` gate.
- `tests/integration/tenant-isolation.test.ts` — same Postgres need.

### 8.3 — Build / dependency hygiene
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` vs `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` version
  mismatch (currently bridged with `as any` since Phase 3).
- Document `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` build-time requirement in
  `MAINTENANCE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`.
- Sweep stale `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY/_YEARLY` placeholders.

### 8.4 — Lint / warning sweep
- The "9 pre-existing warnings on touched files" bag carried through
  every PR.

### 8.5 — Pre-existing `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` violations
- Several `Record<string, unknown>` writes use dot notation; convert to
  `obj['key']` to match strict tsconfig (PR #27 hit this on `cfg`).

## Build order (next 5 PRs)

| # | Phase | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8.1 + 8.3 (subset) | `chore/phase-8-build-fixes` | Unblock `npm run build` first — without it nothing else can be verified end-to-end. |
| 2 | 6 | `feat/phase-6-approval-surfaces` | Tables exist, just needs routes + UI. |
| 3 | 4 | `feat/phase-4-offers` | Reuses `quotes` schema. Public buyer page is small. |
| 4 | 7.3 | `feat/phase-7-3-draft-email` | Highest impact AI surface. |
| 5 | 7.1 | `feat/phase-7-1-lead-scoring` | Then the other AI surfaces in parallel. |

7.2, 7.4, 7.5 can run in parallel after 7.3.
